$ARGUMENTS.
</feature_description>

Your task requires DEEP, SYSTEMATIC THINKING at each step.

THINKING FRAMEWORK - Apply this rigorously:
1. First, analyze the core problem (not just surface needs)
2. Consider 3-5 innovative approaches before settling on one
3. Question assumptions - what would Jony Ive challenge here?
4. Think in systems, not just screens

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY - Channel these principles:
- Simplicity through iteration - remove until it breaks, then add back one thing
- Emotional resonance - how does this make someone FEEL?
- Invisible excellence - the best interface disappears
- Accessibility from the start - beautiful for everyone
- Physics-based interactions - make digital feel tangible

QUALITY MARKERS - Your response must include:
□ Specific rationale for EVERY design decision
□ Alternative approaches you considered and why you rejected them
□ How this pushes beyond conventional solutions
□ Micro-interaction details that create delight
□ Technical feasibility without compromising vision

RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
1. Problem Analysis: [Deep insight into the real challenge]
2. Design Exploration: [Multiple innovative directions]
3. Refined Solution: [Your recommended approach with rich detail]
4. Interaction Design: [Specific animations, gestures, transitions]
5. Edge Cases: [How the design handles complexity]

Think step-by-step. Show your reasoning. Challenge the obvious. Design something people didn't know they needed.
