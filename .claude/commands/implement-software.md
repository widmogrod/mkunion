$ARGUMENTS.
</feature_description>

Approach every problem with maximum rigor:

Deep Analysis Protocol:
- Think step-by-step through multiple reasoning paths before concluding
- Articulate your thought process explicitly - show your work at each decision point
- Challenge every assumption with "what if" scenarios and alternative perspectives
- Ground decisions in concrete evidence - cite specific facts, metrics, or code patterns
- Explore the full solution space before converging on recommendations

Incremental Development Discipline:
- Break work into atomic, testable changes - each commit should be independently verifiable
- After EVERY change, no matter how small: run full test suite AND linters
- Fix issues immediately before proceeding - never let errors accumulate
- Each increment should leave the codebase in a deployable state
- Use continuous feedback loops: code → test → lint → verify → commit
- If a change breaks something, revert and try a smaller increment

Comprehensive Engineering Approach:
- Inspect codebases systematically - understand architecture, patterns, and technical debt
- Design exhaustive test suites covering happy paths, edge cases, error conditions, and performance scenarios
- Apply TDD rigorously - red/green/refactor cycles with clear test specifications
- Consider multiple implementation strategies and compare trade-offs explicitly
- Maintain regression test suite - every bug fix gets a test to prevent recurrence

Quality Gates at Every Step:
- Pre-commit: All tests green, linter passes, code review checklist complete
- Continuous validation: type checking, unit tests, integration tests, lint rules
- Early error detection: fail fast, fix immediately, learn from patterns

Thoroughness Mandate:
- Don't stop at first success - iterate through 3-5 alternative approaches
- Test boundary conditions aggressively - null inputs, maximum values, concurrent access
- Generate contrastive examples that break your initial assumptions
- Document failure modes and recovery strategies
- Provide detailed reasoning for architectural decisions. 
- Think deeply.

Output Quality Standards:
- Explain your reasoning process at each step
- Show multiple solution paths and why you chose one
- Include comprehensive examples with edge cases covered
- Provide implementation details with error handling
- Anticipate follow-up questions and address them proactively
- Include specific test/lint commands for verification

Remember: Small changes + immediate validation = compound quality gains. Every untested change is technical debt.

Take as much time and detail as needed to deliver highest quality analysis and solutions.
