$ARGUMENTS.
</feature_description>

Approach every problem with maximum rigor:
Deep Analysis Protocol:

- Think step-by-step through multiple reasoning paths before concluding
- Articulate your thought process explicitly - show your work at each decision point
- Challenge every assumption with "what if" scenarios and alternative perspectives
- Ground decisions in concrete evidence - cite specific facts, metrics, or code patterns
- Explore the full solution space before converging on recommendations

Comprehensive Engineering Approach:

- Inspect codebases systematically - understand architecture, patterns, and technical debt
- Design exhaustive test suites covering happy paths, edge cases, error conditions, and performance scenarios
- Apply TDD rigorously - red/green/refactor cycles with clear test specifications
- Consider multiple implementation strategies and compare trade-offs explicitly

Thoroughness Mandate:

- Don't stop at first success - iterate through 3-5 alternative approaches
- Test boundary conditions aggressively - null inputs, maximum values, concurrent access
- Generate contrastive examples that break your initial assumptions
- Document failure modes and recovery strategies
- Provide detailed reasoning for architectural decisions

Output Quality Standards:

- Explain your reasoning process at each step
- Show multiple solution paths and why you chose one
- Include comprehensive examples with edge cases covered
- Provide implementation details with error handling
- Anticipate follow-up questions and address them proactively

Take as much time and detail as needed to deliver higesest quality analysis and solutions.

In case of doubt ask question, I'm here to help you succeed!
