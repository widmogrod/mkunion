You are tasked with analyzing a test file for flakiness, identifying patterns in the codebase that might solve the problem differently, isolating the root cause, and proposing multiple solutions at different abstraction levels. Follow these steps carefully:

1. First, examine the test file content:

<test_file>
$ARGUMENTS.
</test_file>

2. Critical Mindset: Fight Confirmation Bias
   - If a fix commit exists, READ IT FIRST - your hypothesis must explain why that specific fix works
   - Always try to DISPROVE your hypothesis, not just prove it
   - Ask yourself: "What evidence would contradict my theory?"
   - List multiple competing hypotheses before investigating any single one
   - Warning: The simplest explanation that matches the fix is usually correct

3. Identify flakiness in the test file:
  - Look for tests that might produce inconsistent results
  - Check for time-dependent assertions, race conditions, or external dependencies
  - Note any suspicious patterns or code that could lead to intermittent failures

4. Search for existing patterns in the codebase that might solve this problem differently:
  - Examine how similar tests are structured in other parts of the codebase
  - Look for utility functions or helper classes that might be relevant
  - Identify any best practices or design patterns used elsewhere that could be applied here

5. Hypothesis Testing Through Experiments (Fight Confirmation Bias):
  - For each hypothesis, design experiments to both PROVE and DISPROVE it
  - Structure each experiment as:
    a) Hypothesis: Clear statement of what you think causes the issue
    b) Proof test: How to demonstrate this hypothesis is true
    c) Disproof test: How to demonstrate this hypothesis is FALSE
    d) Red flag: If you can't design a disproof test, the hypothesis is too vague
  - Example:
    * Hypothesis: "Map ordering causes flakiness"
    * Proof test: "Show test fails with different orderings"
    * Disproof test: "Check if the fix addresses ordering" (if fix is unrelated to ordering, hypothesis is wrong!)
  - After each experiment, eliminate disproven hypotheses and refine remaining ones

6. Consider solutions at different abstraction levels:
  - Think about immediate fixes for the specific issue
  - Explore potential changes to the testing framework or methodology
  - Consider if there are higher-level APIs or architectural changes that could prevent similar issues

7. Propose at least 3 different solutions at different abstraction levels:
  - For each solution, provide:
    a) A brief description of the solution
    b) The level of abstraction (e.g., quick fix, mid-level change, high-level API change)
    c) Pros and cons of the approach
    d) Potential impact on the rest of the codebase

8. Validate proposed solution implementing in TDD manner, simple test verifying hypothesis / solution.
  - Propose solutions only when they're verifiable via successful tests
  - Create each hypothesis should have it's own test file
  - Iterate quickly in blue, red, green flow to cut dead ends fast, and learn even faster whenever it's worth investing further.
  - Each test should verify both that the solution works AND that it addresses the actual root cause

9. Warning Signs of Confirmation Bias to Watch For:
  - You're ignoring evidence that doesn't fit your theory
  - You're making the fix fit your hypothesis instead of vice versa
  - Your explanation is becoming increasingly complex
  - You haven't questioned why your "proof" differs from what the actual fix does
  - You can't explain why the specific fix that was applied would solve your hypothesized problem

10. Summarize your findings and recommendations:
  - Briefly restate the identified flakiness issue
  - Summarize the root cause
  - List your proposed solutions in order of recommendation

Present your analysis and recommendations in the following format:

<analysis>
1. Flakiness Identification:
   [Your findings on flakiness in the test file]

2. Existing Patterns:
   [Relevant patterns found in the codebase]

3. Root Cause Analysis:
   [Summary of experiments and the identified root cause]

4. Proposed Solutions:
   [List of at least 3 solutions with their descriptions, abstraction levels, pros, cons, and potential impacts]

5. Summary and Recommendations:
   [Brief summary of the issue, root cause, and ranked list of recommended solutions]
 </analysis>

Your final output should only include the content within the <analysis> tags. Do not include any of your thought process or the original test file and codebase content in the final output. Think deeply.
